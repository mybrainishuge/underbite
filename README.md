# Underbar Sprint
- Underbar is similar to something like [lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15) or [underscore](http://underscorejs.org)
- Function signatures have been provided in `src/underbar.js` and it's your job to implement the function body so that the tests pass
- Open `SpecRunner.html` in a browser and `src/underbar.js` in your preferred text editor
- When you save changes to `src/underbar.js`, refresh the page for `SpecRunner.html` in your browser to review test progress
